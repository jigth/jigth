# About Me:

Hi, I‚Äôm Daniel Ochoa Montes (@jigth in some social network profiles).  I‚Äôm interested in backend development, software architecture and frontend development. 

I like to develop solutions that are performant and have good user experience in mind, to make that possible I've been studying almost every day about software engineering, and development, with a focus in _backend development_.

For my hobies I like to do physical exercise, movement and read about science, art, technology and human behaviour.


# Languages and Technologies

- üë®‚Äçüíª The languages I like to use the most are **Javascript**, **Python** and **Java**, but I'm willing to learn new programming languages when necessary.
- ‚ö° For libraries and technologies I usually preffer the ones that are multiplatform, with good performance and decent developer experience. But most importantly, the ones that solve the problems on hand well.
- üíæ Talking about databases I've used MySQL, Postgres, and a little bit of SQL-Server.

## Javascript

I've used some tools and frameworks of this language such as NodeJS, Express, React, VueJS, Mongoose, Eslint, Nodemon, Morgan. And I'm looking to learn some new frameworks and Typescript.


## Python

My focus on python until know have been using it as a scripting language for automating simple tasks and transform/analyze/visualize data using some of its great libraries. Pandas, Matplotlib and Sklearn.


## Cloud Computing

I've used some cloud providers such as (AWS and Digital Ocean) to deploy applications (using VMs) and consume services such as managed databases and AWS's Lambda and S3 services.

I also have some experience with command line usage in Unix environments to manage both virtual machines and my local machine to do development and documentation tasks.


## Container Technologies

I've used Docker and I'm familiar with Docker Compose.
