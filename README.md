# About Me:

Iâ€™m Daniel Ochoa Montes (@jigth on some social network profiles). 

I am a Software Engineer with a degree in Systems Engineering, offering a comprehensive background in backend and frontend development, along with proficiency in cloud technologies like AWS. With three years of diverse experience, I have worked in environments ranging from large enterprises with a thousand employees to small startups and personal projects. I am deeply passionate about solving complex software challenges and continually learning and implementing effective, high-performance technologies and patterns to deliver exceptional results.

## Golang

Golang is a great language for developing backend microservices that are really fast, cross platform and produce a binary free of external dependencies.

The reasons mentioned above and the simplicity of the language have been the features that I value the most because they allow to make performant backend services such as APIs and Integrations with CLI tools with ease, having a great development experience while avoiding bugs thanks to its static type system, its module system and its testing system are also a nice part of the Golang language in my opinion.

## Javascript

I've used JavaScript mainly in the frontend context but also did some backend services development using ExpressJS for automating simple tasks.

## Python

My focus on python until know have been using it as a scripting language for automating simple tasks and transform/analyze/visualize data using some of its great libraries. Pandas, Matplotlib and Sklearn. In general, if the task is too simple I would preffer Golang as the language because of performance reasons, the typing system and the compiled code approach, but sometimes Python comes really handy in terms of versatility and ease of development due to its huge library ecosystem.

## Cloud Computing

I've used some cloud providers such as (AWS and Digital Ocean) to deploy applications (using VMs) and consume services such as managed databases and AWS's Lambda and S3 services.

I enjoy using JamStack related technologies for some personal projects such as Netlify, 11ty and NuxtJS because of their unique and new approach to solving current problems in creative ways.

I also have some experience with command line usage in Unix environments to manage both virtual machines and my local machine to do development and documentation tasks.


## Container Technologies

I've used Docker and K8s to make custom images of apps and deploy them in simple contexts.
